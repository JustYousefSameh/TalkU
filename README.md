# TalkU is a VPN Application for Voice Chat
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec66194d-843e-475c-8514-dab902e46435

# Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/V4GT6vQv93) for support or hangout :)

# How it works
TalkU uses [wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) protocol
and [wstunnel](https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel) for obfuscation <br>
It only routes VOIP connections so it doesn't affect your ping
